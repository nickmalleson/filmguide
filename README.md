**Note about the ratings**:

IMDB very helpfully publish a text version of their ratings, see: [http://www.imdb.com/interfaces](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces)

To make the code work, you will need to download the [list of ratings](ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/ratings.list.gz) file and extract it into the [resources](./resources) folder. It needs to be called `ratings.list`.
